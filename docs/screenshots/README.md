## Placeholder Note

Current README uses placeholder paths. Replace these once screenshots are added:
- `docs/screenshots/demo.gif`
- `docs/screenshots/profile-light.png`
- `docs/screenshots/profile-dark.png`
- `docs/screenshots/repos-light.png`
- `docs/screenshots/repos-dark.png`

## Alternative: Quick Setup

If you want to launch quickly without screenshots:

1. Remove screenshot section from README.md
2. Or use text-based feature descriptions
3. Or link to live demo instead

Screenshots can be added later as the project evolves!
